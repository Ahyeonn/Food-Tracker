# Food-Tracker
This website offers users the ability to find out how many calories you should consume per day to maintain your current weight which may help users with their diet goals by balancing their calorie intake. This website also allows users to track down their daily calorie intake each day so that they may achieve their desired body & health goals. This was all made possible by the use of Flask, MongoDB, PyMongo with its virtual environment, and also alerts users with messages, provides an audio player for users to enjoy music on my website, and to calculate their personal calories through JavaScript.
